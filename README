We all think that promo codes are always used to get discounts. But actually it is not so. They are several types
of promo codes. Some promo codes are used for free shipping, some coupons offer buy one get one free, some coupons
are clearance only coupons, rewards point coupons and alot more. We can't avail the benefits of coupon until we know
it actual worth.

A good example of promo code can be seen <a href="http://bestkingspromocode.com/">here</a>
